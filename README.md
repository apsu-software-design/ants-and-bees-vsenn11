> Typedoc was a bit of a pain in the beginning, but the resources listed above made it much easier, the video esp. The --ignoreCompilerErrors flag generated an error for me in Visual Studio, but everything compiled fine in GitBash so I don't think anything went wrong. Also, it was not included in the assignment how to view your typedoc /docs files, which would have been helpful to know. I used the Live Server extension available in Visual Studio.
